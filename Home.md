# Introduction

xcloc is a [multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateration)-based earthquake location tool.  The algorithmic details are summarized in [Dales et. al., 2017](https://github.com/bakerb845/xcloc/blob/master/docs/DalesGJI-2017.pdf).  To gain a much deeper understanding of the methodology it is recommended to read [Ficthner et. al., 2016](  https://github.com/bakerb845/xcloc/blob/master/docs/Fichtner2016.pdf).

1. An overview of this algorithm is described (here)[https://github.com/bakerb845/xcloc/wiki/Building-the-Software].
2. The build instructions are described (here)[https://github.com/bakerb845/xcloc/wiki/Building-the-Software].
